        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <ul id="process">
            <li>
                <p>
                    For project 2, I decided to create a web applciation that gathers data from my spotify account. 
                    Specifically from my most recently played songs list and displays them in the form of a chart using Chart.js
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The process used to design this web application was to create backend scripts to communicate
                    with Spotify's Developer API service. Spotify uses Bearer Oauth token's to validate any developer's 
                    web application. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Authorize Web App</li>
                    <li>Create a script for handling Authorization (key.js)</li>
                    <li>Another script for data manipulation (music.js)</li>
                    <li>Attatch inline script for Spotify API (spotify-web-api-js.js)</li>
                    <li>Attatch another inline script for Chartjs (chart.js)</li>
                    <li>In key.js specify the redirectc URI for the current project</li>
                    <li>Now on the web in the Spotify Developer's page, register the application and whitelist the redirect URI</li>
                    <li>Once page can be redirected, music.js should initialize and create variables necessary to display data.</li>
                    <li>With the spotify api script attatched, the getMyRecentlyPlayedTracks function can be used.<br><br>
                    (Note: This function uses Promises to control data that has not been fully defined yet.)</li>
                    <li>
                        Once in the getMyRecentlyPlayedTracks, store the data into a temp variable and loop through all data items. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For each song, traverse the data that is attatched to the data object. Getting only what is necessary.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After getting the necessary data, the song data is then stored in an array and is further used to construct <br>
                        the display and chart data.   
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The track data is then compared to the textfile database holding all songs that were previously listened to. 
                        <br><br> (Note: Population of data could not be done in browser due to the CORS policy, population done on localized server)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Track names are compared with the database in the hopes to find the number of times a song is listened to. 
                        <br> Track names and count are stored in local storage and accessed to help construct the chart data.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the data from storage is accessed, the chart can be drawn along with the button slider, playbutton widget, <br>
                        expandable legend, and toggable mixed graphs. 
                       
                    </li>
                    
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <ol id="process">
            <li>
                <p>Due to promise statement in spotify functon, localstorage can only load data after a page refresh. 
                    Page refresh detection implemented, performance can vary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Dynamically creating Playbutton widgets in an iframe with spotify's music links introduces authorization errors.
                    Violating the service workers registration from user denied permission. <br> In addition to dom elements being refernced from a different server that the web app cannot account for. 
                </p>
            </li>
            
        </ol>
        <h3>Personal Grade</h3>
        <ul id="process">
            <li>
                <p>
                    When looking at this project in its totallity, I think it aims to achieve more than what was expected with regards to
                    the kind of Authorization needed, the type of data handled, and the amount of scripting done to dynamically create everything from improted data.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    However, due to the nature of the API used, more time would've been needed to fully assess the depts of the cyber security surrounding the platform.
                    <br> While, different implementations were of course used throughout the development of the project, In order to achieve optimal performance, <br>
                    <br>2 functionalities would have to be removed. Or alternatively, if the submission of a node based application were allowed, the web policy's that cause the errors could be resolved. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    With that being said, I have exhausted as many resources (online/in person) to gain a better understanding of Javascript 
                    and web development to even attempt an ambitious project such as this. I think a fair grade would be a B, that taking into account any lack of responsiveness or seperate errors. 
                </p>
